# E3D-ToolChanger
Assembly and Development with E3D ToolChanger 3D printer.

Using the E3D Motion System, I have been working to develop a continuous belt CoreXY ToolChanger style printer. I haven't made much progress yet, and will provide updates in this repository as they become availble. I'm currently using a RAMBo with Marlin firmware and an E3D Titan Aero extruder. I'm using BlackBelt Cura 3.6.2 for slicing, and am working on syncing two belt motors as the Z axis.
